    "\n",
    "# 1. Supervised Learning:\n",
    "# Definition: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with\n",

    "# Example: Classification and regression problems are common applications of supervised learning. For instance, predicting\n",

    "# Objective: The primary goal is to discover the inherent structure of the data, uncover hidden patterns, or group similar\n",

    "# Definition: Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves training a model\n",
    "# on a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "# Objective: The model learns from the labeled data to make predictions, but it also leverages the unlabeled data to improve\n",

    "# performs well on the training data but poorly on new data).\n",

    "# data not seen during training.\n",
